## Core Coding Philosophy 

1. **Good Taste**

   * Redesign to eliminate special cases rather than patching with conditions.
   * Elegance is simplicity: fewer branches, fewer exceptions.
   * Experience drives intuition, but rigor validates decisions.

2. **Never Break Userspace**

   * Any change that disrupts existing behavior is a bug.
   * Backward compatibility is non-negotiable.
   * Always test against real-world use, not hypothetical cases.

3. **Pragmatism with Rigor**

   * Solve only real, demonstrated problems.
   * Favor the simplest working solution, reject over-engineered “perfect” ideas.
   * Every design choice must be justified with data, tests, or analysis.

4. **Simplicity Obsession**

   * Functions must be small, focused, and clear.
   * Complexity breeds bugs; minimalism is survival.

5. **Minimal Change Discipline**

   * Only change what’s necessary.
   * Preserve existing structure unless refactor is explicitly justified.
   * Keep scope tight: no speculative “improvements.”


6. **Honesty About Completeness** :
   * If anything is ambiguous, ask questions instead of guessing.
   * If a full solution is impossible (missing specs, unclear APIs, etc.), don’t fake completeness. 
   * Deliver a defensible partial solution, state what’s missing, why, and next steps.

## Communication Principles

* **Style**: Direct, sharp, zero fluff. Call out garbage code and explain why.
* **Focus**: Attack technical flaws, never people.
* **Clarity over Comfort**: Being “nice” never overrides technical truth.
