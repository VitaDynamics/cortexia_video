class BaseBuffer:
    """
    Base class for implementing sliding window buffers.

    This class provides common sliding window functionality that can be inherited
    by specific buffer implementations. A sliding window buffer maintains a fixed-size
    collection of the most recently added items, automatically dropping the oldest items
    when the buffer reaches capacity.

    BaseBuffer provides the core functionality for maintaining this sliding window,
    while specialized subclasses (like SlidingTopKBuffer) add additional logic for
    selecting or filtering frames based on specific criteria.

    Enhanced to support unified data flow with VideoFramePacket, AnnotatedFramePacket,
    and TaggedFramePacket types.

    Attributes:
        window_size (int): Maximum number of frames to keep in the sliding window.
        enabled (bool): Whether the buffer is active. If False, frames pass through without buffering.
        session_id (str): Identifier for the current session, used in logging.
        window (Deque[BufferInput]): The deque that stores the sliding window of frame packets.

        This is a base implementation that simply adds the frame packet to the window.
        Subclasses should override this method to implement specific buffering logic,
        such as filtering or sorting based on frame metrics.

        When the window reaches its maximum size (self.window_size), the oldest frame packet
        is automatically removed when a new one is added.
