# Documentation Update and Organization Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Documentation

• README.md: Comprehensive overview with installation, usage, and API reference
• docs/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md: Technical architecture design document
• docs/DATA_FLOW.md: Data flow architecture and pipeline details

### Strengths

• Solid architectural documentation
• Good practical examples in cookbook
• Comprehensive README
• Clear coding standards

### Gaps and Opportunities

• Missing API reference documentation
• No developer/contributor guide
• Limited migration guide
• No performance optimization guide
• Missing deployment/operations documentation
• Inconsistent documentation structure
